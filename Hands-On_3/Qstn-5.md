5.Will it effect your results from #1?

Clearly, this modification of algorithm will increase the runtime complexity.If we observe the statement y=i+j is the extra statement that added in modified algorithm.

This will excutes for each iteration of inner loop until it terminates.This addition operation will every time performs the arithmectic operation which puts extra load and upwards the time to excute the algorithm.So,this will increase the overall complexity of algorithm compared to original algorithm.

Eventually,it will effect the results from #1, where the runtime is O(n^2) for the original algorithm but here after changes has been done and after adding the statement y=i+j, the modified algorithm has higher time complexity constant due to additional operation in each iteration.Mainly , this will get effected by the size 'n' and implementation of the input.
